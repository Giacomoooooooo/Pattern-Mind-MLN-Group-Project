# Pattern-Mind-MLN-Group-Project
PatternMind analyzes visual feature representations of images using pretrained ResNet-50 embeddings. Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and nearest-neighbor analysis are used to study visual similarity and show the limits of unsupervised clustering in separating semantic image classes.
